Dedicated youth-worker, martial artist, yogi, and hiking enthusiast. Prior to founding Level Ground, Ali worked with over a dozen nonprofits located in Washington D.C., rural Pennsylvania, Boston, Haiti, and Brazil. She graduated with degrees in International Politics and International Affairs from Penn State University in 2009, and received her MBA from Simmons School of Management in 2013. Ali currently holds a Brown Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and has completed her 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training in Vinyasa Yoga. 

Ali oversees fundraising, operations, programs, and organizational strategy.  Additionally, she teaches the Fierce Females and Yoga programs at Level Ground, and regularly hosts corporate seminars in Self-Defense. However, her favorite part of the job is hanging out/laughing/crying/’doing life’ with the awesome youth the organization serves. When not practicing yoga or training martial arts, Ali enjoys hikes with her dogs, learning the guitar, quality time with friends, reading, and listening to podcasts.
