A Black Belt in both styles of Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (Gi & No-Gi), Green Belt in Japanese Ju-Jitsu, & more recently, has dawned a White Belt in Judo, LeRoi Rodriguez Jr is always striving to make himself & his students become better athletes & human beings by implementing the athletic skills & knowledge he has learned over the years into his No-Gi BJJ classes.

Growing up, he competed in a variety of sports such as Soccer, Handball, Track, Lacrosse (2x MVP) Boxing (New England Boxing Champion), Natural Body Building (2x INBF Champion), Powerlifting (Hyde Park open Powerlifting victor), BJJ (2nd Place NH State Championships), & Obstacle Course Racing (3x Spartan Trifecta & World Championship Qualifier).

Teaching at LG has allowed him to give back to his community & has brought more clarity into the sport that he loves. "While teaching I learn twice. I notice the smaller details of techniques I've done over & over, & I learn from my students when they improvise a technique that may have to be polished but could definitely be a legitimate technique".

LeRoi holds an associates degree in Psychology from Bunker Hill Community College and works as a Life Skills Coach at the Charles River Center where he aids intellectually disabled adults by finding them part-time jobs and implementing them into the community. LeRoi is always willing to help others to become better versions of themselves to live a healthier lifestyle, mentally & physically.
