For the past four years, Rachael worked at Reebok in both Global Brand Strategy and Global Partnership Marketing, where she guided the strategic direction of the brand and focused on bringing 360 marketing activations to life. It was at Reebok that Rachael was introduced to Level Ground, and became a volunteer in 2020 in order to use her essay editing skills from her college coaching side hustle to help students navigate the often overwhelming college application essay process. Rachael currently works at Curaleaf on the National Brand team, where she shapes the future of the cannabis industry, and helps destigmatize legal cannabis usage. Rachael joined the Level Ground board to use her marketing, strategy, partnerships and brand knowledge to help the organization continue to create meaningful impact in the community and beyond.
