Before being a Blue Belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and a manager of the facility, Julio joined Level Ground at the age of 14 while attending Boston Community Leadership Academy in Hyde Park. The bonds that he has made, and continues to make, with each person he meets in Level Ground is the passion that keeps Julio from not missing a single day of work since he was 16 years old. Before he was a manager, Julio had the opportunity to work at Broadway Jiu Jitsu and Accept Personal Training School through the Level Ground Student Trainer program. At Broadway and Accept, he shadowed trainers on how to interact and connect with each person he encounters, while learning to properly instruct the people who want to better themselves, which he now applies at Level Ground. With his responsibilities as manager, he is in charge of payroll for the Student Trainers, greeting and signing people in at the front desk, organizing new and old equipment, keeping the space clean, and ensuring that the youth staff are on task. Needless to say, Level Ground would not operate or be as full of passion without Julio keeping it vibrant, alive, and most importantly together!
