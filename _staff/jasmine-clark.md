Jasmine is a Dorchester native who is passionate about seeing everyone she meets succeed and live the life they deserve. She is a firm believer that your zip code should not define the trajectory of your success. Meeting students from different backgrounds than her own, and realizing the lack of access to educational resources that many inner city students experience, is what set her on her crusade to bringing equity to inequitable circumstances. Jasmine has a BA from Simmons and has worked in the non-profit and public sector for many years starting back when she was a youth herself. At Level Ground, she will spearhead the development, implementation, and impact measurement of our College Access and Student Trainer programs. In her free time, she can be spotted shopping, working out, searching the city for new graffiti and art exhibits, and listening to slam poetry.
