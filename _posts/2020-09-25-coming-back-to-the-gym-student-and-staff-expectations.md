**PAPERWORK**

* Everyone must sign the Attestation Form: Will be available on Wednesday, September 30
* New members should fill out their liability waiver before arrival:

   [for minors](https://www.waiverking.com/print/17834) (parent signature required) [for adults](https://www.waiverking.com/print/17790)
* If you want to be paired with a Jiu Jitsu “Buddy”, [fill out this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMef3KSdxarHXBRakFyyR1yJ6Ps4gsuih_TBGop5MwlpU69g/viewform?usp=sf_link). See below for more context
* Minors must absolutely have their parents sign their forms - no exceptions. If we suspect that you forged your parent signature, we will call your parent for confirmation.

**CLASSES + OPEN GYM RESERVATION**

* While it is not required, we strongly recommend you pre-register for classes and use of the mats/turf space on the [website](http://levelgroundmma.org/gym/). To make it easier for you, we recommend that you download the MindBody app to reserve classes from your phone.
* **NO-SHOWS: PLEASE DO NOT OVER-RESERVE CLASSES**
  * If you pre-register and don’t show 3 times, you will no longer be permitted to pre-register.
* If you pre-register and are more than 10 minutes late for your class, you run the risk of losing your spot to a standby student.
* If you show up for class without pre-registering, you may join the class if capacity has not been reached. If online registration for the class has reached capacity, you will be put on standby and will be allowed to take another students’ place if they are more than 10 minutes late to class.

**CAPACITY**

* FOR CLASSES:
  * Capacity for classes is 12 students until further notice. There should be no more than 12 students on the mats during open mat. The mat space is broken up into 12 10’ x 14’ blocks, you must stay within your block (see exceptions related to partner drills below)
* FOR TURF AREA:
  * Capacity for the use of the turf area is 8 students. Please remain by social distance markers.
* FOR ACADEMIC AREA:
  * Capacity for the Academic area is 10 students.
* Total capacity of the gym will not exceed 25 people at any given time, including staff.
* We will increase the number of classes once classes consistently reach capacity.
* Individuals that are not training athletics, participating in Student Trainer programming, or accompanying a minor will not be permitted to hang out in the building.

**ARRIVING TO THE GYM + WHAT TO BRING**

* Upon arrival at the gym, you must sign in and get your temperature checked.
* Please come already dressed to train. Changing rooms will be limited to one person at a time.
* With the exception of partner drills, you must remain 6+ feet apart from others.
* Cups for water will not be supplied. Bring a water bottle please.
* Yoga mats: you are encouraged to bring your own mat. You may purchase a used mat at LG, or may borrow one provided you clean it before and after use.
* Boxing gloves: you are encouraged to bring your own gloves. You may purchase used gloves at LG. We are no longer sharing gloves as they are difficult to sanitize completely.

**FACE COVERINGS**

* You must wear a face covering at all times, in all areas of the gym. This includes on the turf area while using weight equipment.
* You CAN remove your face covering in the mat space (provided it is not a “vulnerable populations” class):
  * ONLY when you are at a designated, socially-distanced training square
  * ONLY if you are rolling Jiu Jitsu with your designated “buddy” (see details below)
* Please cover your mouth and nose with the face covering. None of us like it - please suck it up. Don’t make us ask you multiple times or you’ll be asked to come back another day :)

**VULNERABLE POPULATION CLASSES**

* For those living/working in proximity to someone higher-risk for COVID-19, we encourage you to attend our vulnerable populations classes indicated on the schedule (if you are high-risk, we strongly encourage you not to attend class)
* During these classes, ALL STUDENTS must wear a mask. No exceptions.

**SANITIZATION**

* Wash your hands/use sanitizer upon arrival, and before and after class
* Equipment and surfaces will be sanitized daily by when the gym opens, before it closes, and in between classes
* You must sanitize any piece equipment you use. Sanitization clothes will be available to use.
* After classes, you will be asked to help wipe down surfaces you use, including heavy bags and the mat space you trained on. The same applies if you use a table in the academic room.
* We will maintain a 15 minute block between classes to allow for proper sanitization
* To monitor air flow/quality, staff will be doing frequent CO2 checks of the space. If CO2 levels rise above 600 ppm, we will ask people to step out. Additionally we have invested in 3 medical grade air purifiers which will be running at all times. Windows will be kept open.

**PARTNER DRILLS + TRAINING**

Boxing and Kickboxing

* For the first 2 weeks of the gym reopening, instructors will be encouraged to teach using the heavy bags. Instructors may permit socially-distanced partner drills (mask required) using ‘fighting sticks.’
  * Exception: if a pair is from the same household, they may do partner drills without the fighting sticks
* On October 19, instructors are permitted to allow consenting students to do partner drills in closer proximity (mask required)
* Students that do not want to participate in partner drills will be given solo drills

Jiu Jitsu

* When we first reopen, Jiu Jitsu class instruction will focus heavily on solo drills and calisthenics, with some exceptions:
  * The “Buddy” structure:
    * Household members, family members, etc are permitted to drill and roll with the SAME person every class (ie. a buddy)
    * If you do not have a family member to train with, you may sign up for a buddy[ here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMef3KSdxarHXBRakFyyR1yJ6Ps4gsuih_TBGop5MwlpU69g/viewform?usp=sf_link) and we will help you match with one other person
    * You may ONLY train with your buddy for the first few weeks of reopening
  * Pods
    * After 3-5 weeks of reopening, we will combine “buddy” pairs to create “pods”
    * Pods will initially include 2 pairs of buddies (4 people), and we will eventually increase this to 3 pairs (6 people)
    * You will be asked to train only with members of your pod
* Minors must have written and explicit permission by their parent to participate in the Buddy and Pod systems via a handwritten note. We may follow up with a phone call for confirmation.

**REVIEW AND ADHERE TO BOTH CDC & STATE GUIDELINES**

* This document is not intended to supplement or replace any guidelines set forth by the CDC or State of Massachusetts. It is your responsibility to keep up to date with the latest guidelines and protocols! Here’s a good start:
  * [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov)
  * [State of Massachusetts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M-TPdc4OaRlq51FihdHcq9rTkLHi_Bsw/view?usp=sharing)

**IN THE CASE OF A POSITIVE TEST**

* If you have symptoms (sore throat, fever, shortness of breath, headache, muscle ache, cough, etc), GET TESTED. [Find a testing center near you](https://www.boston.gov/departments/public-health-commission/map-covid-19-testing-sites).
* Please let us know immediately if you test positive. Your information will be kept confidential from other students. You may return to the gym once you test negative.
* If we receive notice of a positive case, we will notify the Department of Public Health and follow their direct guidance for course of action.
