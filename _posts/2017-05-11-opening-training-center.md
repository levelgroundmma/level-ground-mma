\~\*Moroccan-born. Jiu Jitsu Competitor. 4.0 GPA. Finalist in the Intel International Science Fair. In foster care, but making it through.\*\~

S\* arrived to Boston in 2013, not speaking a lick of English. Upon arrival, she faced abuse from a family member and was unable to report it because of the language barrier. S\* attempted to leave the household multiple times, resulting in a battle with homelessness before transitioning to a group home followed by foster care.

We met S\* in August 2017, and since then she has become an integral part of the LG tribe, taking advantage of every opportunity we have set before her. She has worked at our gym for the last 8 months as a Student Trainer, and competed in her first Jiu Jitsu tournament in February. S\* has diligently met with our tutor every week, culminating her into achieving a 4.0 GPA this year. Most recently, she was one of just 2 winners of the State Science Fair. There were 6,000 total participants.

She says training in Jiu Jitsu makes her feel strong, and that our community has given her a family.

“I came here without clothes. I was homeless and poor. I was hungry and cold. As a teenager that was hard to pass through but I learned a lot that I can use in my future.

I am starting to be another person now. I live without fear.”

This is what Strength looks like: a Level Ground warrior.

\(Every 2 weeks we will be featuring a member of the Level Ground community that personifies our values. S\* approved this write up, and requested that her picture be used for this purpose.)
