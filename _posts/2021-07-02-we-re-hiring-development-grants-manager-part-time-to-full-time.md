# **Development & Grants Manager Job Description**

Level Ground Mixed Martial Arts is a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to empowering urban youth through athletics, academics, and employment opportunities. We use martial arts as a vehicle to create positive, supportive relationships with our students, as well as teach key values such as persistence and determination. As the Development & Grants Manager, you will develop and implement the organization’s fundraising strategies and activities, and manage all grant efforts. This is a part-time position (\~20-25 hours per week) to start, with the intention of becoming a full-time role.

## **About Level Ground Mixed Martial Arts**

Level Ground is the first and only nonprofit organization in the United States that leverages the popular sport of Mixed Martial Arts as a vehicle for positive youth development, and uniquely couples MMA with meaningful academic and employment opportunities.

Founded in 2013, our work began in partnership with the Egleston Square YMCA where we offered martial arts classes once per week to teenagers living in Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan. We gradually expanded beyond athletics and developed our robust "Success Tracks" program model. These College Access and Workforce Development offerings collectively ensure that youth have the skills and opportunities necessary to achieve their ambitions on and off of the mat.

In 2017, we opened our 6,500 square foot Training Center. This Training Center includes two athletic areas and an Academic and Career Development Center, and is managed by our youth staff. Our Student Trainer program provides young people with paid, hands-on skills development in gym management (including operations, administration, and client management), as well as personal training and martial arts instruction. Once they complete the program, youth qualify to earn permanent paid employment and are given significant responsibility as Gym Managers, Personal Trainers, and Athletic Instructors at Level Ground.

Since opening our Training Center, Level Ground has expanded our athletic offerings to include 15+ weekly athletic classes Monday-Friday that remain free to youth and affordable for adults. In 2019, Level Ground served 600+ youth and adults through athletics. This social enterprise model bolsters financial sustainability and helps scale impact by increasing access to engaging physical activity options to community residents of all ages.
