  title: Why?
  description: In addition to athletics, Level Ground provides college access and
    career opportunities to Boston youth.  Our young people are exposed to a disproportionately
    high level of poverty and crime, and live in neighborhoods that experience a greater
    prevalence of obesity-related illnesses. From assistance with college applications
    to employment at our gym, access to our weekly nutrition workshops, and free athletic
    training, Level Ground strives to meet the needs of our youth in an authentic
    and compassionate manner.
