success-stories:
- name: Julio
  image: "/assets/image/julio.jpg"
  story: Julio joined Level Ground in 2014 during his sophomore year of high school,
    and was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu at LG.  In 2016, Julio joined
    the Student Trainer program through which he obtained employment with ACCEPT Personal
    Training School.  Through LG’s partnership with Ben Franklin Institute of Technology,
    Julio had the opportunity to take several college classes during his junior and
    senior years of high school.  In September 2017, Julio entered his freshman year
    at Fisher College and is avidly studying to become a personal trainer.
- name: Andres
  image: "/assets/image/andres.jpg"
  story: Andres has been an integral part of the Level Ground family since 2015.  He
    has taken advantage of all 3 of LG’s Success Tracks, which resulted in him entering
    college at no cost through our partnership with The BASE/Urban College in 2016.  Andres
    is currently a sophomore in college, and currently works at LG as a Youth Manager
    and Assistant Instructor.  He is slated to take the NASM Personal Training Certification
    exam in early 2018.
- name: Little Ali
  image: "/assets/image/little-ali.jpg"
  story: Alisandra (affectionately known as Little Ali) currently serves as one of
    LG’s leading Youth Managers.  She successfully grew into this role during her
    employment with The Club by George Foreman III which she secured through LG’s
    Student Trainer program.  At one point, Little Ali was on the brink of dropping
    out of high school.  However, upon identifying the root cause as inadequate support
    at school, LG successfully transferred her to our partner, Greater Egleston High
    School, where she graduated in 2017 (one year earlier than should would have otherwise.)  Little
    Ali will be pursuing college opportunities in 2018.
