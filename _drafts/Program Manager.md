# **Level Ground MMA Program Manager Job Description**

Level Ground MMA is a 501 (c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to empowering urban youth through athletics, academics, and employment opportunities. We use martial arts as a vehicle to create positive, supportive relationships with our students, as well as teach key values such as persistence and determination. As a Program Manager, you will be responsible for the development of our Summer and Year-Long Student Trainer Programs, management of internal Student Trainers and external volunteer tutors and Student Trainer mentors, and stewardship of key academic program partners.

## **About Level Ground MMA**

Founded in 2013, Level Ground leverages training in Martial Arts and Yoga to create a positive relationship with youth in an engaging and fun fashion. Our professional instructors use the sport to espouse the following values: Discipline, Respect, Humility, Tenacity and Self-Control. Through the guidance of caring instructors, students learn that training is more than physical; that mental discipline and persistence are key to refine physical techniques. These mental/emotional lessons are transferable to our students’ growth off of the mat. Our Yoga program incorporates teachings on mindfulness and provides youth with additional tools to manage stress.

Level Ground’s vision is to bridge the gap between education and workforce development and Boston’s most vulnerable youth through an integrative approach of meaningful longitudinal employment and post-secondary opportunities. Our youth-managed Training Center in Dorchester includes two athletic areas for martial arts, yoga, and personal training, and an Academic and Career Development Center. The majority of our staff are the youth we serve through our youth-employment program. These ‘Student Trainers’ are responsible for all aspects of gym management, operations, administration, and serve as personal trainers and martial arts instructors. In 2020, the Level Ground Student Trainer program offers 30 youth the opportunity to:

* Enter college through the College Access program
